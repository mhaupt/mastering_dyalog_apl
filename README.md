# Overview

This repository contains results and oddbits from my journey through Bernard
Legrand's book _Mastering Dyalog APL_. The book is available for free as a [PDF
download from
Dyalog](https://www.dyalog.com/uploads/documents/MasteringDyalogAPL.pdf). The
files accompanying the book, which I will not include in this repository in
their original form but only with the changes I made, are also available as a
free [ZIP
file](https://www.dyalog.com/uploads/files/MasteringDyalogAPL_CompanionFiles.zip).

Errata for the book can be found [on Dyalog's web
pages](https://www.dyalog.com/mastering-dyalog-apl-errata.htm).

## Environment Preparation

Set the `WSPATH` environment variable to point to the directory in which Dyalog
should look to find and save workspaces. For instance (on a Mac),

    export WSPATH=/Users/.../mastering_dyalog_apl/workspaces
