Source ← 10 4 13 3 9 0 7 6 2 13 8 1 5
Set ← 3 3⍴Source[2 4 8 5 12 13 7 4]

⍝ That makes Set a matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns. From Source, only 8 values
⍝ are used, so the value at index 2 is used twice to fill the matrix. It must
⍝ look like so:
⍝ 4 3 6
⍝ 9 1 5
⍝ 7 3 4 (and the final 4 is reused)

Result ← Source[Set]

⍝ The shape of Result must be 3 3, as it is determined by Set. Its value must
⍝ be:
⍝  3 13  0
⍝  2 10  9
⍝  7 13  3
