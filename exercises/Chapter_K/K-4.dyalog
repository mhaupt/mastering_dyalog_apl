⍝ Create a vector of 15 random numbers between (including) 0.01 and 0.09, with
⍝ 3 significant digits each, dupes allowed.

⍝ Let's create 15 numbers between (including) 10 and 90, and divide those by
⍝ 1000. Commute (⍨) comes in handy.

1000÷⍨9+?15⍴81

⍝ The book's solution is similar, but uses larger numbers.
