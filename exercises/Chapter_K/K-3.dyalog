⍝ Create three variables with random numbers like so ...

⍝ vector of 12 between 8 and 30, no dupes
A ← 7+12?23

⍝ 4x6 matrix with values between 37 and 47, dupes OK
B ← 36+?4 6⍴11

⍝ 5x2 matrix with values between ¯5 and 5, no dupes
C ← 5 2⍴¯6+10?11

⍝ On the last one, the book has the addition of ¯6 as the leftmost operation,
⍝ and that's OK.
