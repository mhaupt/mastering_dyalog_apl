⍝ Evaluate these expressions yourself, and check:

(1○○÷4)*2
⍝ ○÷4 is pi/4, and 1○ that is sin pi/4, which is then squared. The result of
⍝ sin^2 pi/4 is 0.5.

2×0.5+¯2○1○0.5
⍝ 1○0.5 is sin 0.5, and ¯2○ that is arccos of that. 0.5 is added to this, and
⍝ the result is doubled. The expression is 2(0.5+arccos sin 0.5), which is a
⍝ fancy way of writing pi.
