⍝ Calculate these expressions.

-\ 1 1 1 1 1 1
⍝ That will be 1 1-1 1-(1-1) 1-(1-(1-1)) 1-(1-(1-(1-1))) 1-(1-(1-(1-(1-1)))),
⍝ ergo 1 0 1 0 1 0.

-\ 5 4 3 2 1
⍝ That will be 5 5-4 5-(4-3) 5-(4-(3-2)) 5-(4-(3-(2-1))), ergo 5 1 4 2 3.

×/+\6⍴1
⍝ 6⍴1 is 1 1 1 1 1 1. ÷\ that will be 1 2 3 4 5 6. ×/ that will be 720.
